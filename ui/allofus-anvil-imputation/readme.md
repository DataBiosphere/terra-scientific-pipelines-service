# All of US + AnVIL Imputation Service marketing UI
This code is for user education and landing zones in the All of US + AnVIL Imputation Service.

The UI is plain HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript that is simple and easy to update and deploy.  The intended destination URL for this marketing UI is https://terra.bio/allofus-anvil-imputation.  More detail will be added here when deployment is configured.

The main page is index.html, which will map to https://terra.bio/allofus-anvil-imputation.  A secondary page is acknowledgments.html, which will map to https://terra.bio/allofus-anvil-imputation/acknowledgments.  To develop and test, you can use e.g. [Simple Web Server](https://simplewebserver.org/) to see your local web code rendered as web pages.

Please send any questions to scientific-services-support@broadinstitute.org or #imputation-service in Broad Slack.
