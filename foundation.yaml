    Terra Scientific Pipelines Service, or teaspoons, facilitates running a number of defined scientific pipelines 
    on behalf of users that users can't run themselves in Terra. The most common reason for this is that the pipeline
    accesses proprietary data that users are not allowed to access directly, but that may be used as e.g. a reference panel
    for imputation.
