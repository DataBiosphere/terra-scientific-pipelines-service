# Teaspoons email notification templates

This directory contains the email notification templates used by Teaspoons. The templates live in Twilio / SendGrid and there is no automated connection between this repository and the Twilio/SendGrid system. Any edits made in that system should be copied here.

The HTML files can be previewed by pasting the contents into a preview site such as https://htmledit.squarefree.com.
